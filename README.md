Identifying the optimal geometry of the PVT system can demonstrate its real-world potential, utilizing CFD Simulation and energy and exergy estimation codes specifically designed to evaluate
its performance. Machine learning can aid in this process by assimilating data gathered from CFD simulations across different parameters and analyzing it using energy and exergy analysis codes to optimize the system. I intend to employ neural networks to ingest data encompassing thermal energy efficiency, electrical energy efficiency, overall energy efficiency, electrical exergy efficiency, thermal exergy efficiency, overall exergy efficiency, and exergy destruction through the system. Subsequently, the neural network model will furnish essential parameters required for optimizing output, such as the diameter of the tube, water inlet velocity, width, length, and solar radiation intensity of the system. Determining the number of hidden layers and units within those layers remains pending. However, the hyperparameters will be fine-tuned following an initial data analysis to guarantee the model's accuracy. To validate the outcomes of this machine learning model, a design optimization was previously conducted utilizing RSM (Response Surface Methodology) for optimization.
